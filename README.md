## About Me

I’m an AI researcher focused on **Agentic Frameworks**, **RAG architectures**, **Foundational Models**, **efficient Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)**, **multilingual tokenization**, and **multimodal/VLM evaluation**. I’ve contributed to **Krutrim LLM** (Indic-first multilingual models and tokenizer work) and built **agentic evaluation** frameworks for vision-language models during my **Cohere** internship. I enjoy turning research ideas into production-grade systems and measuring what matters—benchmarks, latency, and business impact.
